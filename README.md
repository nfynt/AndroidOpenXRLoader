# Unity Generic OpenXR Loader For Android

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/com.nfynt.openxr.genericandroidloader.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/com.nfynt.openxr.genericandroidloader)


A generic [OpenXR loader](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenXR/specs/1.0/loader.html) for android devices in Unity. Unity's [OpenXR package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.openxr@1.4/manual/index.html) doesn't support runtime discovery on Android as per the [OpenXR specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenXR/specs/1.0/loader.html#runtime-interaction), and expects XR loader from the respective platform provider (Oculus support feature for default case).

This loader is a simple Unity XR wrapper above Khronos [hello_xr](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK-Source/tree/main/src/tests/hello_xr) loader. It has been tested with Monado Runtime for android with Vulkan and OpenGLES3.
